 *6.Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' having two methods. 
 * First method named as 'setDim' takes length and breadth of rectangle as parameters and the 
 * second method named as 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.
